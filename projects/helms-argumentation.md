summary: "A short analysis on George Helm's Personal Statement written for PHIL 100."
---
As part of my introductory philosophy course, I wrote a short analysis of George Helm's Personal Statement found in his personal journal. 

George Helm was a Hawaiian activist and musician who played a significant role in the movement to protect the Hawaiian island of Kahoolawe. The island had been used for bombing exercises by the U.S. military for several decades, resulting in significant damage to the island's ecosystem and cultural sites. He and other activists led efforts to raise awareness about the issue and advocated for the halt of military exercises on the island.

In the analysis, I examined how Helm wrote his call-to-action. I described the imagery and structure of his arguments, as well as the rhetorical/persuasive techniques used to invoke a response from the reader. A project such as this allows me to discern and identify implementations of formal logic and deductive reasoning.

<blockquote>
            George Helm’s central argument goes as follows:
            
            Premise #1: The ‘aina is sacred and needs to be cared for.
            Premise #2: I must protect the ‘aina.
            Premise #3: The US military is destroying the ‘aina.
            Conclusion: Thus, it is my duty to put an end to the military’s treatment of the ‘aina. 
<blockquote>
