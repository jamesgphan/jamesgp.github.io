Coding standards may seem like a pedantic aspect of software development, often reduced to debates over indentation and curly brace placement. However, these seemingly minor details play a more significant role in shaping the development process and the quality of the code than one might think.

One aspect that's often underestimated is how coding standards aid in learning a programming language. When developers follow conventions such as declaring and initializing variables in a consistent manner, it becomes easier for newcomers to grasp the language's nuances.

ESLint, when integrated with development environments like IntelliJ, serves as a powerful ally in enforcing coding standards. While getting that coveted green checkmark may sometimes feel like a daunting task, it's undeniably rewarding. ESLint acts as a vigilant code reviewer, catching not only stylistic issues but also potential bugs and  vulnerabilities. It nudges developers toward best practices, making code more readable and maintainable.

In a growing code ecosystem or within a large development team, the significance of coding standards becomes even more evident. As the team evolves, with new members joining and others moving to different projects, adherence to coding standards ensures continuity and reduces the friction of transitioning between codebases.

Coding standards enhance code readability. Consistency in how code is structured, including the placement of brackets, makes it easier to follow the logic and understand the code's flow. It minimizes the cognitive load of maintaining and enhancing the code over time, a critical factor as projects scale and become more complex.
